\details{
NHANES body measures data are used to monitor trends in infant and child growth,
to estimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity in U.S. children, adolescents,
and adults, and to examine the associations between body weight and the health and
nutritional status of the U.S. population.

The new collected Sagittal Abdominal Diameter (SAD) data will be used to establish
population-based reference ranges, and to improve the health risk assessments associated
with body weight and obesity.

The measurements and target age groups for the NHANES 2015â€“2016 body measures
component are as follows:

  \itemize{
    \item Weight: All ages
    \item Head circumference: birth through 6 months of age
    \item Recumbent length: birth through 47 months of age
    \item Standing height: 2 years and older
    \item Upper leg length: 8 years and older
    \item Upper arm length: 2 months of age and older
    \item Mid-upper arm circumference: 2 months of age and older
    \item Waist circumference: 2 years of age and older
    \item Sagittal abdominal diameter: 8 years of age and older
