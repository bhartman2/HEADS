Blood Pressure

BP is measured on participants 8 years and older;
radial (or brachial, if necessary) pulse is measured on participants 5 years and older;
and heart rate is measured on children 0-4 years of age.

\details{
After resting quietly in a seated position for 5 minutes and after the participantâ€™s
maximum inflation level (MIL) has been determined, three consecutive BP readings are obtained.
asurement is interrupted or incomplete, a fourth attempt may be made.
All BP determinations (systolic and diastolic) are taken
in the mobile examination center (MEC). Participants with any of the following on both arms were excluded from the exam: rashes, gauze dressings, casts, edema, paralysis, tubes, open sores or wounds, withered arms, a-v shunts, radical mastectomy. Participants were also excluded if the BP cuff does not fit on the arm. BP measurements are taken in the right arm unless specific conditions prohibit the use of the right arm, or, if participants report any reason that the BP measurements should not be taken in the right arm.

Prior to BP measurements, upper arm circumference is measured,
which is done to guide selection of cuff size. Details on the protocol
for obtaining upper arm circumference is described in the
Physician Examination Procedures Manual.
